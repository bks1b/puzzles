{
a+b+c=x
a^2+b^2=c^2
}

Squaring the first equation:

a^2+b^2+c^2+2ab+2ac+2bc=x^2 => ab=x^2/2-cx

Rewriting the system of equations and taking @a@ as the smaller solution:

{
ab=x^2/2-cx
a+b=x-c
}
=> a=(x-c-sqrt((x+c)^2-2x^2))/2

Minimizing and maximizing @a@:

(x-c)^2=(x+c)^2-2x^2 => c=x/2
(x+c)^2-2x^2=0 => c=x(sqrt2-1)

Therefore the solution is @cx^2/2-c^2x@ where @x(sqrt2-1)<c<x/2@ and @(x-c-sqrt((x+c)^2-2x^2))/2 in NN@.
The difference of consecutive discriminants is @2(x+c)+1@.
